# Workout Tracker Application
This is a workout application where users can create training plans and track their workout results. In the application, you can:

- Create a new training plan for yourself.
- Add a new workout according to your training plan.
- Track your progress in workouts compared to your previous workout and the first workout in your training plan.

This project is still a work in progress. The user interface of the application is a simple React application built with Create React App. Currently, the backend of the application is being developed using Node.js. The database will be created using PostgreSQL.

## Technologies in use
- Node
- Express

## Future features
I am currently further developing the application and have planned to implement at least the following features:
1. User Authentication and Registration: Implement a comprehensive user authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts securely. 
2. Backend: Deploy a robust backend system that efficiently handles user requests and provides appropriate responses
3. Database: Create a secure and efficient database to store application data. 
4. Containerization: Utilize container technology (Docker) to streamline the deployment process.

Stay tuned for updates! I aim to make the application much more advanced.
